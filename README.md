# QDWB_Version_1.0
This code was developed under my master thesis project titled "Development of a Quasi-Distributed Water Balance Model for Arid and Semi-Arid Regions".
Considering the lack of required data for water balance modeling in most regions of Iran, I decided to develop a process-based model based on the data that can easily be accessed. So at the same time, the aim is to make the algorithm as simple as possible.
This version of QDWB is the initial edition and is expected to be further developed for better results.
