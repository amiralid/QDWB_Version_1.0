# QDWB_Version_1.0
This code was developed under my master thesis project titled "***Development of a Quasi-Distributed Water Balance Model for Arid and Semi-Arid Regions***" to estimate the water balance model in a catchment scale. Inputs are prepared in ASCII format and represent the Rokh-Neishabour study area in Iran.

QDWB was designed based on available data to avoid struggling with inadequacies. Briefly explaining, rather than runoff routing, this model uses a runoff source area approach that only enables specific areas to generate runoff. In addition, groundwater storage is not monitored, however, withdrawal allocation for agriculture is estimated based on crop modeling.

*This version of QDWB is the initial edition and is expected to be further developed for better results.*
